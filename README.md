# task-management-dashboard
This project is a simple yet powerful task management app that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Built with React for the front-end and Redux for state management, this app also includes features such as task filtering (by all, completed, pending, and overdue tasks) and a responsive design.
